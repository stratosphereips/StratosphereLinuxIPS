# This configuration file controls several aspects of the working of Slips

# [1] Input Processing

# Regular expresions to separate the columns
[regexes]
# If not specified no format checking occures on that column. 
# This could be helpful when slips receives different input formats on the same port. 
# By default columns are verified to see if they are comma separated or TAB separated.
column0 = r'\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}:\d{2,4}\s\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}.\d+'
column1 = r'\d+'

# Format of the timestamp used in the column startTime. This is the default used by slips. Remember to always use our ra.conf file when reading flows into slips.
[timestamp]
# Default format for argus flows in slips
format = %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S.%f
# Other format
#format = %m-%d-%y %H:%M:%S.%f

# [2] Logging of Errors 
# This controls the debug output of slips in a log file. The logging is related to errors and situations about the working of the program.
[logging]
logfile = ./slips.log
# Minimum debug level to show. From the level selected, down, everything will be shown
# logging.DEBUG    Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
# logging.INFO    Confirmation that things are working as expected.
# logging.WARNING    An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
# logging.ERROR    Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
# logging.CRITICAL    A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
loglevel = WARNING
# The loglevel works for the file, but the console log is fixed to CRITICAL. This is different from the debug parameter.



# [3] Parameters that can be also specified with modifiers in the command line

# [3.1] This controls the output of slips in the console 
[parameters]
# The verbosity is related to how much data you want to see about the detections useful for an administrator, behaviors, normal and malicious traffic, etc.
verbose = 1
# The debugging is related to how much you want to see about the inner workings of the algorithm, how the models are compared, the flows coming from the file, etc.
debug = 0

# [3.2] The width of the time window used
# 1 minute
#time_window_width = 60
# 5 min
#time_window_width = 300
# 1 hour
time_window_width = 3600
# 1 day
#time_window_width = 86400
#  One time window only. Is like if not time windows were used. Beware that the names of the files for the TW have a year in the name that is 100 years back.
#time_window_width = 'only_one_tw'

# [3.3] Home Network
#home_network = 192.168.1.0/24
#home_network = 10.0.0.0/8
#home_network = 172.16.0.0/12
#home_network = 147.32.0.0/16

# The home_network variable can also be an individual IP address, so you can focus on a specific host
#home_network = 10.0.0.123


# [3.4] How often should we create log files? In seconds
log_report_time = 5

# [3.5] Analyze only what goes OUT of the home_net? or also what is coming IN the home_net?
# Options: out, all
# In the _out_ configuration we only pay attention to what each IP in the home net _produces_. We look at the traffic _originating_ from the home net only. The behavior of each IP. If its attacked from the outside we don't process that
#analysis_direction = out

# In the _all_ configuration we still only create 1 profile for each IP in the home net (opposite to 1 profile for each external IP connecting to the home net), but when the external IPs connect to the hosts int he home net, we process that traffic also.
# This is useful if you want to know how you are attacked also.
analysis_direction = all

# Parameter to know if we should create the log files or not. Only yes or no
create_log_files = yes


# [4] Configuration for the detection
[detection]
# This threshold means: minimum confirmed attacks per minute needed to generate an alert
evidence_detection_threshold = 0.1
#evidence_detection_threshold = 0.25
#evidence_detection_threshold = 1
#evidence_detection_threshold = 2
#evidence_detection_threshold = 10
