# This configuration file controls several aspects of the working of Slips


#####################
# [1] Input Processing

# Regular expresions to separate the columns
[regexes]
# If not specified no format checking occures on that column. 
# This could be helpful when slips receives different input formats on the same port. 
# By default columns are verified to see if they are comma separated or TAB separated.
column0 = r'\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}:\d{2,4}\s\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}:\d{1,2}.\d+'

# Format of the timestamp used in the column startTime. This is the default used by slips. Remember to always use our ra.conf file when reading flows into slips.
[timestamp]
# For timestamps as second leave not defined.
# Default format for argus flows in slips
#format = %Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S.%f
# Other format
#format = %m-%d-%y %H:%M:%S.%f




#####################
# [2] Logging of Errors
# This controls the debug output of slips in a log file. The logging is related to errors and situations about the working of the program.
[logging]
logfile = ./slips.log
# Minimum debug level to show. From the level selected, down, everything will be shown
# logging.DEBUG    Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
# logging.INFO    Confirmation that things are working as expected.
# logging.WARNING    An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future (e.g. ‘disk space low’). The software is still working as expected.
# logging.ERROR    Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function.
# logging.CRITICAL    A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running.
loglevel = WARNING
# The loglevel works for the file, but the console log is fixed to CRITICAL. This is different from the debug parameter.

# [3.5] Analyze only what goes OUT of the home_net? or also what is coming IN the home_net?
# Options: out, all
# In the _out_ configuration we only pay attention to what each IP in the home net _produces_. We look at the traffic _originating_ from the home net only. The behavior of each IP. If its attacked from the outside we don't process that
