        Check if an ARP packet is gratuitous

        The Gratuitous arp is sent as a broadcast, as a way for a

        its IP to MAC mapping to the entire network.
        Gratuitous ARP shouldn't be marked as an arp scan
        Check https://www.practicalnetworking.net/series/arp/gratuitous-arp/
        dst_mac is the real MAC used to deliver the packet
        src_mac is the real MAC used to deliver the packet
        dst_hw is the MAC in the headers of the ARP packet

        saddr is the IP in the headers of the ARP packet
        daddr is the IP in the headers of the ARP packet

        (2) Announcing a Node’s Existence,
        (3) Redundancy, (4) MITM. Which is similar to an
        'unrequested' load balancing
