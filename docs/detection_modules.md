# Detection modules

Slips is a behavioral-based IPS that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in the network traffic. It is a modular software that can be extended. When Slips is run, it spawns several child processes to manage the I/O, to profile attackers and to run the detection modules.

Here we describe what detection modules are run on the traffic to detect malicious behaviour.


Modules are Python-based files that allow any developer to extend the functionality of Slips. They process and analyze data, perform additional detections and store data in Redis for other modules to consume. Currently, Slips has the following modules:

### Virustotal Module

This module is used to lookup IPs, domains, and URLs on virustotal.

To use it you need to add your virustotal API key in ```config/vt_api_key```

### RiskIQ Module

This module is used to get different information (passive DNS, IoCs, etc.) from [RiskIQ](https://www.riskiq.com/)
To use this module your RiskIQ email and API key should be stored in ```config/RiskIQ_credentials```  
  
the format of this file should be the following:  
  
```  
example@domain.com  
e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855  
```  
  
The hash should be your 64 character API Key.  
  
The path of the file can be modified by changing the ```RiskIQ_credentials_path``` parameter in ```config/slips.conf```

## RNN C&C Detection Module

This module is used to detect command and control channels in a network by analyzing the features of the network flows and representing them as Stratosphere Behavioral Letters(Stratoletters). This is achieved through the use of a recurrent neural network, which is trained on these letters to identify and classify potential C&C traffic.

### Stratoletters

Stratoletters is a method used to represent network flows in a concise and standardized manner.
Stratoletters encodes information about the periodicity, duration, and size of network flows into a string of letter(s) and character(s).

The **letter** is the key part in a Stratoletter string. It is derived from a dictionary and defined based on the features of the flow such as periodicity, size and duration.

*periodicity* : A number that denotes how frequent the flow is, calculated based on time of past flows

-1 = No previous data

1-4 = 1 strongly periodic to 4 strongly not periodic

*size* : Number denotes the size of flow, range from 1 to 3

*duration* : Number that denotes the duration of flow, range from 1 to 3

A visual representation of the dictionary from which letter is derived

In this image, each block represents the possible values of the letter, 
We choose the block based on the periodicity
and choose the letter from the block based on the duration(number of row) and size (number of column).

![stratoletters letter mapping matrix](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stratosphereips/StratosphereLinuxIPS/develop/docs/images/stratoletters.png)


Example:
```commandline
# Slips computed value of the flow
periodicity = 1     # Strongly periodic
duration = 1
size = 3
letter = g          # lowercase letter for periodicity 1(Strongly periodic) and 3(Weakly not periodic)
```
```commandline
periodicity = -1    # no previous flow data
duration = 2
size = 3
letter = 8          # the letter will be an integer if there is no previous data
```
```commandline
periodicity = 4     # Weakly not periodic
duration = 3
size = 3
letter = Z          # uppercase letter for periodicity 2(Weakly periodicity) and 4(Strongly not periodicity)
```

Stratoletters represent details of current flow and past available flow with latest on left. The current flow symbol is concise of three parts.

each symbol consists of hrs passed since last flow + a letter that represents the periodicity,size and dur of the 
flow + a char showing the time passed since last flow

```
symbol = zeros + letter + timechar
 ```

*zero* : hours passed since last flow, each hour is represented by 1 zero. foe xample, 2 hours = ```00```

*letter* : chosen based on the periodicity, size, and dur of the flow eg: `1`,`w`,`H`

*timechar* : character to denote the time eloped since last flow, can be: `.`, `,`, `+`, `*` or null

Ultimately this is how a Stratoletter is formed
```commandline
No of hours passed since last flow = 2
periodicity = 2     # Weakly not periodicity
duration = 1
size = 1
timechar = 
stratoletter of last flow = 9*z*
letter = A
symbol = 00A9*z*

No of hours passed since last flow = 0
periodicity = 3     # Weakly not periodic
duration = 1
size = 2
timechar = *
stratoletter of last flow = e.
letter = u
symbol = u*e.
```
Then the model will predict how secure each flow is based on the Stratoletter
```commandline
symbol = 99*z*i.i* 
model_score = 0.9573354
symbol = 99. 
model_score = 0.9063127
symbol = 77*g.g*g*g.g.g.g*x*x*x*g.g.
model_score = 0.96772265
```
In first example **9** is Stratoletter of current flow. **9*** is previous one, **z*** is before that and so on.

## Leak Detection Module

This module on runs on pcaps, it uses YARA rules to detect leaks.

You can add your own YARA rule in ```modules/leak_detector/yara_rules/rules``` and it will be automatically compiled and stored in ```modules/leak_detector/yara_rules/compiled``` and matched against every pcap.

## Blocking Module

To enable blocking in slips, start slips with the ```-p``` flag. 

This feature is only supported in linux using iptables.

## Exporting Alerts Module

Slips supports exporting alerts to other systems using different modules (ExportingAlerts, CESNET sharing etc.) 


For now the supported systems are:

- Slack
- TAXII Servers (STIX format)
- Warden servers
- suricata-like JSON format
- Logstash


Refer to the [exporting section of the docs](https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/develop/exporting.html) for detailed instructions on how to export.


## Flowalerts Module

This module is responsible for detecting malicious behaviours in your traffic.
    
Refer to the [Flowalerts section of the docs](https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/develop/flowalerts.html) for detailed explanation of what Slips detects and how it detects.

## Disabled alerts

All Slips detections are turned on by default, You can configure which alerts you want to enable/disable in ```config/slips.conf``` 

Slips support disabling unwanted alerts, simply add the detection you want to disable in
the ```disabled_detections``` list and slips will not generate any alerts of this type.

for example:

    disabled_detections = [MaliciousJA3, DataExfiltration, SelfSignedCertificate]


Supported detections are:


ARPScan, ARP-outside-localnet, UnsolicitedARP, MITM-ARP-attack, SSHSuccessful, 
LongConnection, MultipleReconnectionAttempts,
ConnectionToMultiplePorts, InvalidCertificate, UnknownPort, Port0Connection, 
ConnectionWithoutDNS, DNSWithoutConnection,

DNS-ARPA-Scan, SMTPLoginBruteforce, BadSMTPLogin, 
IncompatibleUserAgent, ICMP-Timestamp-Scan, ICMP-AddressScan, ICMP-AddressMaskScan


## Threat Intelligence Module

Slips has a complex system to deal with Threat Intelligence feeds. 
Slips supports different kinds of IoCs from TI feeds (IPs, IP ranges, domains, JA3 hashes, SSL hashes)
File hashes and URLs aren't supported in TI feeds.
Besides the searching 40+ TI files for every IP/domain Slips encounters, It also uses the following websites for threat intelligence:

## CIRCL.LU

Slips looks up for (MD5) files hashes for downloaded files found in the files.log  ```CIRCL.LU API``` . This lookup is handled by the ThreatIntel class's ```circl_lu function```.

Slips creates the following URL for every file that is downloaded:```https://hashlookup.circl.lu/lookup/md5/<md5_hash>```. This URL is used to query the CIRCL.LU API with the file's MD5 hash.

It parses the result after sending a GET request to this URL.

Slips collects pertinent data, including confidence level, threat level, and blacklist sources, if the answer indicates that the file is known to be malicious.

After that, it creates an evidence object and stores it in the database, indicating that a malicious file was downloaded, by calling the set_evidence_malicious_hash method.

## URLhaus

Slips looks up file hashes (MD5) and URLs for malicious content using the URLhaus API. These lookups are handled by the URLhaus class.

Slips constructs a URL to query the URLhaus API for URLs encountered in http.log or downloaded files found in files.log. It can do this by using the URL itself ```(https://urlhaus-api.abuse.ch/v1)``` or the MD5 hash.

It sends the URL or MD5 hash as the payload of a POST request to the relevant URL.

If the response indicates that the URL or hash is known to be malicious, Slips parses the response to extract pertinent information such as threat level, description, tags, and file details (if applicable).

For malicious URLs, it calls the set_evidence_malicious_url function to create an evidence object and store it in the database, indicating that a malicious URL was accessed.

For malicious file hashes, it calls the set_evidence_malicious_hash function to create an evidence object and store it in the database, indicating that a malicious file was downloaded.

## Spamhaus

Slips checks if an IP address is listed as a known source of spam or malicious behavior using the Spamhaus DNS-based Blacklist (DNSBL).
 
This lookup is handled by the spamhaus function of the ThreatIntel class. Slips creates a DNS query for every IP 
address it encounters by reversing the address and appending .zen.spamhaus.org. For example, the query for IP 1.2.3.4 would be ```4.3.2.1.zen.spamhaus.org```. 
 
Using the dns.resolver.resolve function from the dns Python library, it resolves the DNS for this query. A non-empty result from the resolution indicates that the IP address is listed on one or more Spamhaus blacklists. 
 
Slips parses the response to determine which specific Spamhaus blacklists the IP is listed in and retrieves the corresponding descriptions and threat levels. 
 
It then calls the set_evidence_malicious_ip function to create an evidence object and store it in the database, indicating that a malicious IP was encountered.

### Matching of IPs

Slips gets every IP it can find in the network (DNS answers, HTTP destination IPs, SSH destination IPs, etc.) 
and tries to see if it is in any blacklist.

If a match is found, it generates an evidence, if no exact match is found, 
it searches the Blacklisted ranges taken from different TI feeds.


### Matching of Domains
Slips gets every domain that can find in the network and tries to see if it is in any blacklist.
The domains are currently taken from:

- DNS requests
- DNS responses
- HTTP host names
- TLS SNI

Once a domain is found, it is verified against the downloaded list of domains 
from the blacklists defined in ```ti_files``` path in the configuration file ```config/slips.conf```. 
which is ```config/TI_feeds.csv``` by default.
If an exact match is found, then an evidence is generated. 

If an exact match is not found, then Slips verifies if the verified domain is a
subdomain of any domain in the blacklist. 


For example, if the domain in the traffic is _here.testing.com_,
Slips first checks if the exact domain _here.testing.com_ is in any blacklist,
and if there is no match, it checks if the domain _testing.com_ is in any blacklists too.

### Matching of JA3 Hashes

Every time Slips encounters an TLS flow,
it compares each JA3 and JA3s with the feeds of malicious JA3 and alerts when
there’s a match.
Slips is shipped with the Abuse.ch JA3 feed by default
You can add your own SSL feed by appending to the ```ja3_feeds``` key in ```config/slips.conf```

### Matching of SSL SHA1 Hashes

Every time Slips encounters an SSL flow, it tries to get the certificate hash from zeek ssl.log,
then it compares the hash with our list of blacklisted SSL certificates

Slips is shipped with the Abuse.ch SSL feed by default,

You can add your own SSL feed by appending to the ```ssl_feeds``` key in ```config/slips.conf```

### Matching of ASNs

Every time Slips sees a new IP, it stores info about it in the db, for example its organization, RDNs, and ASN.
If the ASN of an IP matches a blacklisted ASN, slips alerts.

Blacklisted ASNs are read from out local TI file ```config/local_data_files/own_malicious_iocs.csv```, 
so you can update them or add your own.

### Local Threat Intelligence files

Slips has a local file for adding IoCs of your own, 
it's located in ```config/local_data_files/own_malicious_iocs.csv``` by default,
this path can be changed by changing ```download_path_for_local_threat_intelligence``` in ```config/slips.conf```.

The format of the file is "IP address/IP Range/domain/ASN","Threat level", "Description"

Threat level available options: info, low, medium, high, critical

Refer to the [architecture section of the docs](https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/develop/architecture.html) for detailed explanation of Slips threat levels.


Example:
    
    "23.253.126.58","high","Simda CC"
    "bncv00.no-ip.info", "critical", "Variant.Zusy"

### Local JA3 hashes

Slips has a local file for adding JA3 hashes of your own, 
it's located in ```config/local_data_files/own_malicious_JA3.csv``` by default.

The format of the file is "JA3 hash", "Threat level", "Description"

Threat level available options: info, low, medium, high, critical

Refer to the [architecture section of the docs](https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/develop/architecture.html) for detailed explanation of Slips threat levels.

Example:

    "e7d705a3286e19ea42f587b344ee6865","medium","Standard tor client"
    "6734f37431670b3ab4292b8f60f29984", "high", "Trickbot Malwar"


### Adding your own remote feed


We update the remote ones regularly. The list of remote threat intelligence 
files is set in the path of ```ti_files``` variable in ```config/slips.conf```.
The path of all the TI feeds is in ```config/TI_feeds.csv``` by default.

You can add your own remote threat intelligence feeds in this variable.
Supported extensions are: .txt, .csv, .netset, ipsum feeds, or .intel.

Each URL should be added with a threat_level and a tag, the format is (url,threat_level,tag) 

tag is which category is this feed e.g. phishing, adtrackers, etc..

Threat level available options: info, low, medium, high, critical

Refer to the [architecture section of the docs](https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/develop/architecture.html) for detailed explanation of Slips threat levels.


TI files commented using # may be processed as they're still in our database. 

Use ```;``` for commenting TI files in ```config/slips.conf``` instead of ```#```.

Commented TI files (lines starting with ;) will be completely removed from our database.


The remote files are downloaded to the path set in the ```download_path_for_local_threat_intelligence```. 
By default, the files are stored in the Slips directory ```modules/ThreatIntelligence1/remote_data_files/``` 
are deleted after slips is done reading them.


### Commenting a remote TI feed

If you have a remote file link that you wish to comment and remove from the database
you can do so by adding ';' to the line that contains the feed link in ```config/TI_feeds.csv```, don't use the '#'
for example to comment the ```bruteforcelogin``` feed you should do the following:
    
    ;https://lists.blocklist.de/lists/bruteforcelogin.txt, medium,['honeypot']

instead of:

    #https://lists.blocklist.de/lists/bruteforcelogin.txt,medium,['honeypot']

## Update Manager Module

To make sure Slips is up to date with the most recent IoCs in all feeds,
all feeds are loaded, parsed and updated periodically and automatically by 
Slips every 24 hours, which requires no user interaction.

The 24 hours interval can be changed by changing the ```TI_files_update_period``` key in ```config/slips.conf```

Update manager is responsible for updating all remote TI files (including SSL and JA3 etc.)

By default, local slips files (organization_info, ports_info, etc.) are 
cached to avoid loading and parsing

then everytime we start slips. However, they are updated automatically by 
the update manager if they were changed on disk.

Only one slips instance is allowed to be using the update manager at a time to avoid race conditions.

By default, slips starts without the TI files, and runs the Update Manager in the background
 if the ```wait_for_TI_to_finish``` option in slips.conf is set to yes, slips will not start until the update manager is done
 and all TI files are loaded successfully, 
this is useful if you want to ensure that slips doesn't miss
the detection of any blacklisted IPs, but it adds some time to the startup of slips
since it will be downloading, parsing, and caching 45+ different TI feeds.


## IP Info Module

The IP info module has several ways of getting information about an IP address, it includes:

- ASN
- Country by Geolocation 
- Given a MAC, its Vendor 
- Reverse DNS

### ASN

Slips is shipped with an offline database (GeoLite2) in ```databases/GeoLite2-ASN.mmdb``` 
to search for ASNs, if
the ASN of a given IP is not in the GeoLite2 database, we try to get the ASN online
using the online database using the ```ipwhois``` library.
However, to reduce the amount of requests, we retrieve the range of the IP and we cache the whole range.
To search and cache the whole range of an IP, the module uses the ipwhois library. 
The ipwhois library gets the range of this IP by making a connection to the server ```cymru.com``` using a TXT DNS query. 
The DNS server is the one set up in the operating system. For example to get the ASN of the IP 13.32.98.150, 
you will see a DNS connection asking for the TXT record of the domain ```150.98.32.13.origin.asn.cymru.com```.

### Country by Geolocation 

Slips is shipped with an offline database (GeoLite2) in ```databases/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb``` 
to search for Geolocation.

### Mac Vendors

Slips is shipped with an offline database ```databases/macaddress-db.json``` for 
MAC address vendor mapping.

Slips updates this database by default every 2 weeks using the following online db

https://maclookup.app/downloads/json-database/get-db?t=22-08-19&h=d1d39c52de447a7e7194331f379e1e99f94f35f1

You can change how often this db is updated by changing the value of
```mac_db_update``` in ```config/slips.conf```.

Slips gets the MAC address of each IP from dhcp.log and arp.log and then searches the offline
database using the OUI.

If the vendor isn't found in the offline MAC database,
Slips tries to get the MAc using the online database https://www.macvendorlookup.com

The offline database is updated manually and shipped with slips, you can find it in 
the ```databases/``` dir.

Slips makes sure it doesn't perform duplicate searches of the same MAC Address either online, or offline.

## Reverse DNS
This is obtained by doing a standard in-addr.arpa DNS request.

## ARP Module

This module is used to check for ARP attacks in your network traffic.

By default, zeek doesn't generate and log ARP flows, but Slips is shipped with it's 
own zeek scripts that enable the logging of ARP flows in ```arp.log```

The detection techniques are:

- ARP scans
- ARP to a destination IP outside of local network
- Unsolicited ARP
- MITM ARP attack

### ARP Scans

Slips considers an IP performing an ARP scan if it sends 5 
or more non-gratuitous ARP to different destination addresses in 30 seconds or less.

### ARP to a destination IP outside of local network

Slips alerts when an ARP flow is being sent to an IP outside of local network as it's a weird behaviour 
that shouldn't be happening.

### Unsolicited ARP

Unsolicited ARP is used to update the neighbours' ARP caches but can also be used in ARP spoofing, we detect it with
threat level 'info', so we don't consider it malicious, we simply notify you about it.

### MITM ARP attack

Slips detects when a MAC with IP A, is trying to tell others that now that MAC 
is also for IP B (ARP cache attack)


## CESNET sharing Module

This module is responsible for importing and exporting alerts from and to warden server

Refer to the [exporting section of the docs](https://stratospherelinuxips.readthedocs.io/en/develop/exporting.html) 
for detailed instructions on CESNET exporting and the format of the configuration files.

To enable the importing alerts from warden servers,
set ```receive_alerts```  to ```yes``` in config/slips.conf  

Slips imports 100 alerts from warden servers each day, and automatically stores the IoCs in our database


Time to wait before receiving alerts from warden server is 1 day by default, you can change this
by chaning the ```receive_delay``` in ```config/slips.conf```


These are the categories Slips imports:
['Availability', 'Abusive.Spam','Attempt.Login', 'Attempt', 'Information', 'Fraud.Scam', 'Information', 'Fraud.Scam']

## HTTP Analyzer Module

This module handles the detections of HTTP flows

Available detection are:

- Multiple empty connections
- Suspicious user agents
- Incompatible user agents
- Multiple user agents
- Pastebin downloads
- Unencrypted HTTP traffic

### Multiple empty connections

Due to the usage of empty connections to popular site by malware to check for internet connectivity,
We consider this type of behaviour suspicious activity that shouldn't happen

We detect empty connection to 'bing.com', 'google.com', 'yandex.com', 'yahoo.com' , 'duckduckgo.com' etc.

### Suspicious user agents

Slips has a list of suspicious user agents, whenever one of them is found in the traffic, slips generates
and evidence.

Our current list of user agents has:
['httpsend', 'chm_msdn', 'pb', 'jndi', 'tesseract']
  
### Incompatible user agents

Slips uses and offline MAC address database to detect the type of device based on the MAC OUI.

First, Slips store the MAC address and vendor of every IP it sees (if available)

Second, When slips encounters a user agent in HTTP traffic it performs an online
query to http://useragentstring.com to get more info about this user agent, 
like the os type, name and browser.

Third, When slips has both information available (MAC vendor and user agent),
it compares them to detect incompatibility using a list of keywords for each operating system.

Available keywords for Apple: ('macos', 'ios', 'apple', 'os x', 'mac', 'macintosh', 'darwin')

Available keywords for Microsoft: ('microsoft', 'windows', 'nt') 

Available keywords for Android: ('android', 'google')

### Multiple user agents

Slips stores the MAC address and vendor of every IP it sees 
(if available) in the redis database. Then, when an IP iss seen 
using a different user agent than the one stored in the database, it tries to extract
os info from the user agent string, either by performing an online
query to http://useragentstring.com or by using zeek.

If an IP is detected using different user agents that refer to different
operating systems, an alert of type 'Multiple user agents' is made

for example, if an IP is detected using a macOS user agent then an android user agent,
slips detects this with 'low' threat level

### Pastebin downloads

Some malware use pastebin as the host of their malicious payloads. 

Slips detects downloads of files from pastebin through HTTP with size >= 700 bytes. 

This value can be customized in slips.conf by changing ```pastebin_download_threshold```

When found, slips alerts pastebin download with threat level low because not all downloads from pastebin are malicious.


### Unencrypted HTTP traffic

When slip sees an HTTP unencrypted traffic in zeek's http.log it generates 
an evidence with threat_level low

## Leak Detector Module

This module work only when slips is given a PCAP

The leak detector module uses YARA rules to detect leaks in PCAPs

### Module requirements

In order for this module to run you need:
<ul>
  <li>to have YARA installed and compiled on your machine</li>
  <li>yara-python</li>
  <li>tshark</li>
</ul>

using 
```sudo apt install yara```

You can install tshark by running

`sudo apt install wireshark`


### How it works

This module works by

  1. Compiling the YARA rules in the ```modules/leak_detector/yara_rules/rules/``` directory
  2. Saving the compiled rules in ```modules/leak_detector/yara_rules/compiled/```
  3. Running the compiled rules on the given PCAP
  4. Once we find a match, we get the packet containing this match and set evidence.


### Extending 

You can extend the module be adding more YARA rules in ```modules/leak_detector/yara_rules/rules/```. 

The rules will be automatically detected, compiled and run on the given PCAP.

If you want to contribute, improve existing Slips detection modules or implement your own detection modules, see section :doc:`Contributing <contributing>`.


## Network Service Discovery Module

This module is responsible for detecting scans such as:
- Vertical port scans
- Horizontal port scans
- PING sweeps
- DHCP Scans


### Vertical port scans

Slips considers an IP performing a vertical port scan if it contacts 5 or more different destination ports to the same destination IP in at least one time window (usually 1hs). The flows can be both, Non-Established TCP or UDP flows. On each arriving flow this check is performed.

After detecting a vertical port scan for the first time, if Slips detects new flows to 5 destination ports, then it triggers a waiting process to find out how many packets to new ports will arrive. For this it waits 10 seconds to see if more flows arrive, since in most port scans the attcker will scan more ports. This avoids generating one alert 'port scan' per flow in a long scan. Therfore Slips will wait until the scan finishes to alert on it. However, the first portscan is detected as soon as it happens so the analysts knows.

If one alert was generated (Slips waited 10 seconds and no more flows arrived to new ports in that dst IP) then the counter resets and the same attacker needs to do _again_ more than threshold destinations ports in one IP to be detected. This avoids the problem that after 5 flows that generated an alert, the 6 flow also generates an alert.

The total number of _packets_ in all flows in the scan give us the confidence of the scan.


### Horizontal port scans

Slips considers an IP performing a horizontal port scan if it contacted more than 6 destination IPs on the same
specific port with not established connections. Slips checks both TCP and UDP connections for horizontal port scans.
The initial threshold is now 6 destination IPs using the same destination ports. 

After detecting a horizontal port scan, Slips waits 10 seconds to see if more flows arrive,
since in most port scans the attcker will scan more ports. This avoids generating one port scan alert per flow in a long scan. Therfore Slips will wait until the scan finishes to alert on it. However, the first portscan is detected as soon as it happens so the analysts knows.

If one alert was generated (Slips waited 10 seconds and no more flows arrived to new IPs) then the counter resets and the same attacker needs to do _again_ more than threshold destinations IPs in the same port to be detected. This avoids the problem that after 6 flows that generated an alert, the 7 flow also generates an alert.

Slips ignores the broadcast IP 255.255.255.255 has destination of port scans.


### PING Sweeps

ICMP messages can be used to find out which hosts are alive in a network.
Slips relies on Zeek detections for this, but it is done with our own Zeek scripts located in 
zeek-scripts/icmps-scans.zeek. The scripts detects three types of ICMP scans: 'ICMP-Timestamp', 'ICMP-Address', 'ICMP-AddressMask'.

We detect a scan every threshold. So we generate an evidence when there is 
5,10,15, .. etc. ICMP established connections to different IPs.

Slips does this detection using Slips' own zeek script located in 
zeek-scripts/icmps-scans.zeek for zeek and pcap files and using the portscan module for binetflow files.

### DHCP Scans

DHCP requests can be used to find out which IPs are taken in a network.
Slips detects when an IP is requesting 4, 8, 12, etc. different IPs from the DHCP server within the same
twimewindow (1 hour by default)

# Connections Made By Slips

Slips uses online databases to query information about many different things, for example (user agents, mac vendors etc.)

The list below contains all connections made by Slips

useragentstring.com -> For getting user agent info if no info was found in Zeek
macvendorlookup.com -> For getting MAC vendor info if no info was found in the local maxmind db
maclookup.app -> For getting MAC vendor info if no info was found in the local maxmind db
ip-api.com -> For getting ASN info about IPs if no info was found in our Redis DB
ipinfo.io -> For getting your public IP
virustotal.com -> For getting scores about domains, IPs and URLs 
urlhaus-api.abuse.ch -> For getting info about URLs and downloaded files
check.torproject.org -> For getting info about tor exist nodes.
cert.pl -> Used in our list of TI files.
abuse.ch -> Used by urlhaus for getting info about contacted domains and downloaded files.

## Zeek Scripts

Slips is shipped with it's own custom zeek scripts to be able to extend zeek functionality and 
customize the detections

### Detect DoH

In the ```detect_DoH.zeek``` script, slips has it's own list of ips that belong to dns/doh servers,

When slips encouters a connection to any IP of that list on port 443/tcp, it assumes it's a DoH connetion,

and times out the connection after 1h so that the connection won't take too long to appear in slips.

### Detect ICMP Scans

In the ```zeek-scripts/icmps-scans.zeek``` script, we 
check the type of ICMP in every ICMP packet seen in the network,

and we detect 3 types of ICMP scans: ICMP-Timestamp-Scan, ICMP-AddressScan,
and ICMP-AddressMaskScan based on the icmp type

We detect a scan every threshold. So we generate an evidence when there is 
5,10,15, .. etc. ICMP established connections to different IPs.


### Detect the Gateway address

The ```zeek-scripts/log_gw.zeek``` script is responsible for recognizing the gateway address using zeek, and logging it to
notice.log
