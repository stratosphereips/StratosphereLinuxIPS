	- Add a test file for nfdump.
	- In the threat intelligence configuration add by default the file https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/CTU-AIPP-BlackList/Todays-Blacklists/AIP_blacklist_for_IPs_seen_last_24_hours.csv. It has a blacklist of IP addresses that are attacking the Internet. Coming from the stratosphere laboratory and the aposemat project. The AIP program.
	- In the threat intelligence configuration add by default the file https://mcfp.felk.cvut.cz/publicDatasets/CTU-AIPP-BlackList/Todays-Blacklists/AIP_historical_blacklist_prioritized_by_newest_attackers.csv. It has a blacklist of IP addresses that are attacking the Internet. Coming from the stratosphere laboratory and the aposemat project. The AIP program.
	- In the threat intelligence configuration add by default the file https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Te-k/stalkerware-indicators/master/network.csv with domains used for stalkerware
	- In the threat intelligence module configuration, add a static version of the IPs of the NSO group from Amnesty from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmnestyTech/investigations/master/2018-08-01_nso/indicators.csv
	- Change the old test-flows folder for the dataset folder
	- New section in the configuration file with the threat intelligence data
	- Ignore warnings
	- Update the template module
	- Read as input a zeek folder full of logs with -f
	- Fixed bugs in the timeline of Kalipso
	- New lstm module to detect C&C channels in the network. It detects channels by running a machine learning LSTM network on the behavioral letters.
	- Several bug fixed
	- New DNS blacklist management in the threat intelligence module
	- Better store of IPs in the database
	- Fix an error in how the behavioural letters where created
- 0.6.6 
	- Added DNS resolution for IPs in timeline
	- Added inTuple key to the timeline for inbound flows when analysis_direction = 'all'
	- Changed the timeline format in Slips and Kalipso
	- Defined host IP in Slips and Kalipso if Slips is run on interface
- 0.6.5 
	- Fixed Threat Intelligence module to be fully functional.
	- Added new feature to stop Slips automatically when input files ends.
	- Fixed the storing and display of inbound flows in analysis direction 'all'.
	- Fixed Kalipso to display inbound flows and h hotkey to display out tuples
- 0.5 Completely renewed architecture and code.
- 0.4 was never reached
- 0.3.5
- 0.3.4
	- This is a mayor version change. Implementing new algorithms for analyzing the results, management of IPs, connections, whois database and more features.
	- A new parameter to specify the file (-r). This is as fast as reading the file from stdin.
	- Now we have a configuration file slips.conf. In there you can specify from fixed parameters, the time formats, to the columns in the flow file.
- 0.3.3alpha
	- First stable version with a minimal algorithm for detecting behavioral threats.
