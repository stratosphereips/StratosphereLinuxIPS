detection:

  # Evidence detection threshold is the minimum accumulated threat level per

  # the optimal false positive rate and TPR.
  # Here are more options
  #
  # - 0.08: Use this threshold If you want Slips to be super sensitive with
  # higher FPR. Using this means you are less likely to miss a detection but
  # more likely to get false positives
  #
  # - 0.25: Optimal threshold, has the most optimal and balanced FPR and TPR.
  # - 0.43: Use this threshold If you want Slips to be insensitive.
  #        Using this means Slips will need so many evidence to trigger an alert
