# 
# A whitelist of IPs, domains, organisations or mac addresses 
#

# The columns are:
# Column IoCType
#   Supported types: 
#    ip: the IoC is an ipv4 or ipv6 address
#    domain: the IoC is a domain
#    organization: the IoC is a complete organisation defined by Slips
#    mac: the Ioc is a mac address
#
# Column IoCValue
#   The value of the IoC according to the previous type 
#   ip example for ipv4: 1.1.1.1
#   ip example for ipv6: fe80::ed12:2222:2222:2222
#   domain example: google.com
#   mac addresses example: a1:a2:a3:a4:a5:a6
#
# Column Direction
#  Supported directions:
#   src: The IoCValue should be the source of the flow
#   dst: The IoCValue should be the destination of the flow
#   both: The IoCValue can be the source or destination of the flow
#
# Column IgnoreType
#  Supported types of ignoring
#  alerts: Ignore and don't show alerts matching this IoC. Slips reads and shows all the flows, but it doesn't show the alert
#  flows: Ignore the flows that match this IoC. Slips, as soon as possible, ignores and don't process flows matching this IoC
#
# If you have multiple lines with the same IoCValue, only the last line will be considered
