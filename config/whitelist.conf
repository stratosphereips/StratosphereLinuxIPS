#    ip: the IoC is an ipv4 or ipv6 address
#    domain: the IoC is a domain
#    organization: the IoC is a complete organisation defined by Slips
#    mac: the Ioc is a mac address
#
# Column IoCValue
#   The value of the IoC according to the previous type 
#   ip example for ipv4: 1.1.1.1

#
# Column Direction
#  Supported directions:
#   src: The IoCValue should be the source of the flow

#   both: The IoCValue can be the source or destination of the flow
#
# Column IgnoreType
#  Supported types of ignoring
#  alerts: Ignore and don't show alerts matching this IoC. Slips reads and shows all the flows, but it doesn't show the alert
