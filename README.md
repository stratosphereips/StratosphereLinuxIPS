# Slips: Behavioral Machine Learning-Based Intrusion Prevention System


Slips is a powerful endpoint behavioral intrusion prevention and detection system that uses machine learning to detect malicious behaviors in network traffic. Slips can work with network traffic in real-time, PCAP files, and network flows from popular tools like Suricata, Zeek/Bro, and Argus. Slips threat detection is based on a combination of machine learning models trained to detect malicious behaviors, 40+ threat intelligence feeds, and expert heuristics. Slips gathers evidence of malicious behavior and uses extensively trained thresholds to trigger alerts when enough evidence is accumulated.

# Introduction
Slips is the first free software behavioral machine learning-based IDS/IPS for endpoints. It was created in 2012 by Sebastian Garcia at the Stratosphere Laboratory, AIC, FEE, Czech Technical University in Prague. The goal was to offer a local IDS/IPS that leverages machine learning to detect network attacks using behavioral analysis. 


Slips is supported on Linux and MacOS only. The blocking features of Slips are only supported on Linux

Slips is Python-based and relies on [Zeek network analysis framework](https://zeek.org/get-zeek/) for capturing live traffic and analyzing PCAPs. and relies on
Redis >= 7.0.4 for interprocess communication.


# Usage

The recommended way to use Slips is on Docker.

#### Linux
```
docker run --rm -it -p 55000:55000 --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name slips stratosphereips/slips:latest
```

``` 
./slips.py -f dataset/test7-malicious.pcap -o output_dir
```

```
cat output_dir/alerts.log
```

#### Macos M1

```
docker run --rm -it -p 55000:55000 --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name slips stratosphereips/slips_macos_m1:latest
```

``` 
./slips.py -f dataset/test7-malicious.pcap -o output_dir
```

```
cat output_dir/alerts.log
```


#### Macos Intel

```
docker run --rm -it -p 55000:55000 --net=host --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --name slips stratosphereips/slips:latest
```

``` 
./slips.py -f dataset/test7-malicious.pcap -o output_dir
```

```
cat output_dir/alerts.log
```

or our command-line based interface Kalipso 

##### Web interface

    ./webinterface.sh

Then navigate to ```http://localhost:55000/``` from your browser.

# Troubleshooting

If you can't listen to an interface without sudo, 
you can run the following command to let any user use Zeek to listen to an interface not just root.

```
sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip /<path-to-zeek-bin/zeek
```
