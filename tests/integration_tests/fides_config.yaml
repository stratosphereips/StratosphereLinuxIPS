detection:

   # Here are more options
   # - 0.08:  Use this threshold If you want Slips to be super sensitive with higher FPR,
   #        using this means you are less likely to miss a
   #        detection but more likely to get false positives
   # - 0.25:  Optimal threshold, has the most optimal FPR and TPR.
   # - 0.43:  Use this threshold If you want Slips to be insensitive.
